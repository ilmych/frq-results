                    <p>The essay presents a defensible thesis on animal experimentation ethics but would benefit from condensing it into a single, more specific statement. While effectively using evidence from multiple sources and demonstrating sophisticated thinking through philosophical questions, the essay needs stronger connections between evidence and claims with more direct analysis rather than rhetorical questions. For improvement, develop a clearer line of reasoning throughout, explicitly connect each piece of evidence to the main argument, and structure points more coherently with smoother transitions between ideas.</p>

                            <p>The essay contains a defensible thesis that establishes a line of reasoning about animal experimentation. The thesis spans across multiple sentences in the first paragraph: "Animal experimentation has long been a subject of intense ethical debate in the scientific community. While these practices have contributed to medical knowledge & human welfare, the moral implications raise serious questions about its continued necessity. The ethical cost of inflicting suffering on sentient beings demands a reevaluation of this method." This thesis takes a clear position that acknowledges the historical contributions of animal testing while arguing that ethical concerns necessitate reconsidering its use, directly responding to the prompt's question about benefits and ethics of animal research.</p>

                            <p>This essay earns 2 points for evidence and commentary. The student cites evidence from at least three sources (A, B, and E), showing an attempt to support claims with relevant information. There is a developing line of reasoning about the ethical dilemma of animal testing, but connections between evidence and argument remain underdeveloped. For example, the student cites Source B about cancer treatments that worked in mice but not humans, which supports their point about questionable results, but doesn't fully explain how this undermines animal testing's validity. Similarly, while the student references Source E's five morally relevant features, the commentary raises interesting ethical questions but doesn't clearly establish how these features relate to a cohesive argument about animal testing. The evidence is sometimes integrated into the discussion but often feels disconnected from the overall argument.</p>

                            <p>To improve to a higher score, the student should develop a clearer line of reasoning throughout the essay. Rather than posing rhetorical questions after citing evidence ("Who gets to decide this? Who gets to play God?"), provide direct analysis explaining how each piece of evidence supports specific claims about animal testing. For example, when citing Source B about cancer treatments, explain precisely how this undermines the scientific justification for animal testing. Additionally, integrate all evidence more effectively by explicitly connecting it to your main argument. When discussing Source E's moral features, explain how these specific criteria support your position on animal rights rather than just raising philosophical questions. Finally, distribute evidence more evenly throughout the essay to support different aspects of your argument instead of concentrating it in certain paragraphs.</p>

                            <p>The essay earns a score of 1 for Row C because it demonstrates sophistication of thought in several ways. The student effectively explores the complexities of the ethical debate surrounding animal experimentation by examining multiple perspectives and posing thought-provoking questions. For example, the essay extends the moral reasoning from Source E into a philosophical thought experiment: "If a human being lacks the previously mentioned features, should they be experimented on?" This demonstrates a complex understanding of the rhetorical situation by challenging readers to apply the same criteria consistently across species. The student also employs a persuasive style with rhetorical questions ("Who gets to play God?") and introduces the trolley problem to situate the argument within broader ethical frameworks. The essay doesn't simply reject animal experimentation outright but rather acknowledges the paradox of "advancing human welfare at the expense of other sentient beings," showing nuanced thinking about this complex issue.</p>

                            <p>While the essay demonstrates sophistication, it could be strengthened in the following ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Structure the argument more coherently</strong> - The essay sometimes jumps between ideas without clear transitions. A more sophisticated response would develop each point fully before moving to the next.</li><li><strong>Incorporate more precise evidence</strong> - When citing Source E's five morally relevant features, provide specific examples of how these features apply to the argument instead of simply mentioning them.</li><li><strong>Develop a more balanced perspective</strong> - Though the essay acknowledges the benefits of animal testing, it could more deeply engage with the strongest arguments for animal experimentation rather than focusing primarily on the ethical objections.</li><li><strong>Use more precise language</strong> - Replace general statements like "This raises an even greater moral dilemma" with more specific explanations of exactly what dilemma is created and why it matters.</li></ul><p>A more sophisticated response might include statements like: "The criterion of sentience presented in Source E forces us to confront an uncomfortable reality: if we justify experimenting on animals because they lack certain cognitive capacities, we create a slippery slope where humans with similar limitations could theoretically be subject to the same treatment—a conclusion that virtually no one would accept. This inconsistency reveals that our justifications may be based more on species membership than on morally relevant characteristics."</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>The essay has a defensible thesis analyzing Einstein's rhetorical adaptation across different contexts, but needs refinement to be more concise and specific. The primary weakness is the lack of specific textual evidence and analytical depth, as the essay merely summarizes differences between passages rather than analyzing how Einstein's rhetorical choices serve different purposes. To improve, incorporate direct quotes from both passages, develop deeper analysis of specific rhetorical devices (beyond just 'technical' versus 'emotional' language), and explore the significance of Einstein's stylistic shifts when addressing scientific versus social topics.</p>

                            <p>The essay contains a defensible thesis in its opening statement: "Einstein exemplifies his rhetorical skill in adapting his writing style to different subjects. While comparing the passages, we see a clear shift between technical writing about physics & more emotional language about social issues. In doing this, Einstein makes his work accessible to everyone regardless of their knowledge on the matter." This thesis directly responds to the prompt by analyzing Einstein's use of language and rhetoric in both passages, asserting that he deliberately adapts his style to different subjects and purposes. The thesis identifies specific rhetorical shifts (technical vs. emotional language) and suggests a purpose (making work accessible to different audiences).</p>

                            <p>This essay receives a score of 1 because it provides mostly general evidence and offers limited commentary that primarily summarizes the differences between the two passages rather than analyzing rhetorical choices in depth. The student identifies some broad differences (e.g., "precise & technical language" vs. "simple & clear language") but does not provide specific textual evidence from either passage to support these claims. When the essay mentions Einstein's 'formal academic language' or 'personal opinions/statements,' it fails to cite specific examples from the passages that demonstrate these qualities. The commentary mainly restates observed differences without explaining how these rhetorical choices shape Einstein's arguments or contribute to his purpose in each passage.</p>

                            <p>The thesis appears in the first paragraph: "The idea that treating people based on their potential shapes how they develop gives us important insights into human growth & relationships. When we hold high expectations for others, we create an environment that helps them become better versions of themselves." This thesis directly responds to Goethe's statement by affirming its validity as a realistic guide to personal relationships. The student takes a clear, defensible position that treating people according to their potential has a positive influence on their development, which directly addresses the prompt's request to comment on the validity of Goethe's statement.</p>

                            <p>The essay provides specific evidence across several key areas to support its claims about the power of positive expectations in human development. The essay presents a clear line of reasoning about how treating people based on their potential shapes their development in educational settings, personal relationships, and broader society. The student uses specific evidence from their educational experience at Alpha School, describing how teachers' high expectations create confidence that leads to better work. The essay also provides evidence about parental relationships and how treating children as capable builds independence and emotional maturity. The commentary consistently explains connections between the evidence and the central argument that expectations shape outcomes, though some connections could be developed more thoroughly.</p><p>The student effectively explains how positive expectations create a \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" and how environment shapes success. The essay acknowledges potential counterarguments about pressure and disappointment and responds by distinguishing between nurturing potential versus imposing impossible standards. This demonstrates a thoughtful line of reasoning throughout the essay.</p>

                            <p>To strengthen the evidence and commentary, the student should provide more specific examples from their experience at Alpha School, detailing particular situations or outcomes rather than general observations. The essay would benefit from concrete illustrations of how specific teacher behaviors led to measurable improvements in performance or confidence. The parent-child relationship evidence could be enhanced with real examples showing the contrast between treating children as capable versus inferior. While the essay acknowledges counterarguments, it could develop this section with evidence from studies about appropriate expectations and psychological effects. Additionally, the ripple effect mentioned in the conclusion could be supported with sociological evidence or community examples that demonstrate the broader impact of positive expectations.</p>

                            <p>While this essay presents a clear argument about the power of positive expectations in shaping human potential, it lacks the sustained sophistication necessary for a point in Row C. The essay acknowledges that treating people according to their potential has impacts across various settings (education, parenting, friendships), but it doesn't deeply analyze the complexities or tensions within this position. For example, the counterargument about high expectations creating pressure is mentioned but quickly dismissed without thorough exploration of this tension. The writing is clear and straightforward but doesn't consistently demonstrate a vivid or particularly persuasive style that would strengthen the argument. Examples like 'when my teachers consistently show high expectations & confidence in my abilities, I feel confident & strong' are effective but remain at a relatively surface level without probing deeper psychological or sociological implications.</p>
